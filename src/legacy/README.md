# Legacy / archived modules

This directory holds unused components, hooks, and helpers that were identified during codebase cleanup. They are not imported by the app and are preserved only as references (e.g., legacy Aurora background, data-table suite, demo users, old sign-up form, KPI helper). Migrate or delete them as needed before shipping.
